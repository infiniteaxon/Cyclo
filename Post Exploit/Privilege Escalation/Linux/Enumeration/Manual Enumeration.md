Commands and Places to look:


**Hostname:**
Although this value can easily be changed or have a relatively meaningless string (e.g. Ubuntu-3487340239), in some cases, it can provide information about the target system’s role within the corporate network (e.g. SQL-PROD-01 for a production SQL server).

```
hostname
```


**Uname:**
Will print system information giving us additional detail about the kernel used by the system. This will be useful when searching for any potential kernel vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation.

```
uname -a
```


**/proc/version**
Give you information on the kernel version and additional data such as whether a compiler (e.g. GCC) is installed.

**/etc/issue**
This file usually contains some information about the operating system but can easily be customized or changed.

**/etc/passwd**
Easy way to discover users on the system.

```
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f 1
```
OR
```
cat /etc/passwd | grep home
```


PS:
An effective way to see the running processes on a Linux system.

- PID: The process ID (unique to the process)
- TTY: Terminal type used by the user
- Time: Amount of CPU time used by the process (this is NOT the time this process has been running for)
- CMD: The command or executable running (will NOT display any command line parameter)

|Operators||
|---|---|
|-A|View all running processes|
|axjf|View process tree|
|aux|Show processes for all users|

```
ps
```


**env:**
Show environmental variables.

```
env
```


**sudo -l:**
List all commands your user can run using sudo.

```
sudo -l
```


**ID:**
Provides a general overview of the user’s privilege level and group memberships.

```
id
```


**History:**
Look at command history.

```
history
```


**ifconfig:**
Give us information about the network interfaces of the system.

```
ifconfig
```

**ip route:**
See which network routes exist.

```
ip route
```


**Netstat:**
Gather information on existing connections.
- `netstat -a`: shows all listening ports and established connections.
- `netstat -at` or `netstat -au` can also be used to list TCP or UDP protocols respectively.
- `netstat -l`: list ports in “listening” mode. These ports are open and ready to accept incoming connections. This can be used with the “t” option to list only ports that are listening using the TCP protocol (below)
- `netstat -s`: list network usage statistics by protocol (below) This can also be used with the `-t` or `-u` options to limit the output to a specific protocol.
- `netstat -tp`: list connections with the service name and PID information. This can also be used with the `-l` option to list listening ports.
- `netstat -i`: Shows interface statistics. We see below that “eth0” and “tun0” are more active than “tun1”.

The `netstat` usage seen most often in blog posts, write-ups, and courses is `netstat -ano` which could be broken down as follows:
- `-a`: Display all sockets
- `-n`: Do not resolve names
- `-o`: Display timers


**Find:**
Used to find files on target system.

- `find . -name flag1.txt`: find the file named “flag1.txt” in the current directory
- `find /home -name flag1.txt`: find the file names “flag1.txt” in the /home directory
- `find / -type d -name config`: find the directory named config under “/”
- `find / -type f -perm 0777`: find files with the 777 permissions (files readable, writable, and executable by all users)
- `find / -perm a=x`: find executable files
- `find /home -user frank`: find all files for user “frank” under “/home”
- `find / -mtime 10`: find files that were modified in the last 10 days
- `find / -atime 10`: find files that were accessed in the last 10 day
- `find / -cmin -60`: find files changed within the last hour (60 minutes)
- `find / -amin -60`: find files accesses within the last hour (60 minutes)
- `find / -size 50M`: find files with a 50 MB size (+/- to find file greater than or less than given size)
- `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`: Find files with the SUID bit, which allows us to run the file with a higher privilege level than the current user.
