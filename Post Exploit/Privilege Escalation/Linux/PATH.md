These are the locations Linux will look in for an executable.

Find folders with permissions to write in via:

```
find / -writable 2>/dev/null
```
OR (get rid of results related to running processes)
```
find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d "/" -f 2,3 | grep -v proc | sort -u
```

If any of these folders are under $PATH, you can modify scripts in them to launch any binary. These can be used to spawn a shell with root privilege.
