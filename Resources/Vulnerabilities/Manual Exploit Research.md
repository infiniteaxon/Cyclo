**Rapid7**
Much like other services such as Exploit DB and NVD, Rapid7 is a vulnerability research database. The only difference being that this database also acts as an exploit database. Using this service, you can filter by type of vulnerability (I.e. application and operating system).


**GitHub**
GitHub is extremely useful in finding rare or fresh exploits because anyone can create an account and upload – there is no formal verification process like there is with alternative exploit databases. With that said, there is also a downside in that PoC’s may not work where little to no support will be provided.


**Searchsploit**
You are able to search searchsploit by application name and/or vulnerability type. You can search searchsploit for exploits relating to Wordpress that we can use – no downloading/internet necessary!
