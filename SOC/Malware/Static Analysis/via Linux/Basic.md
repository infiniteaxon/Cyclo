#### First Steps
- Figure out what type of file it is
	- `file {MALWARE}`
- Check for strings
	- `strings {MALWARE}`
		- pipe to `more` or `less` for readability
- Hash the malware
	- `{hashfun} {MALWARE}`
		- `md5sum`, `sha1sum`, `sha256sum`
- Check hashes and files on VirusTotal

#### Second Steps (PE Headers)
- Check Imports/Exports
- Sections
	- `.text` - This Section generally contains the CPU instructions executed when the PE file is run. This section is marked as executable.
	- `.data` - This Section contains the global variables and other global data used by the PE file.
	- `.rsrc` - This Section contains resources that are used by the PE file, for example, images, icons, etc.
	- `.rdata`, `.ndata`
- To inspect PE headers
	- `pecheck {MALWARE}`
		- For tree inspection GUI use
			- `pe-tree {MALWARE}`
