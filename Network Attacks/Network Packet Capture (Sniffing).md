- TCP Dump
Sniffing attack refers to using a network packet capture tool to collect information about the target. When a protocol communicates in cleartext, the data exchanged can be captured by a third party to analyse.Â A simple network packet capture can reveal information, such as the content of private messages and login credentials, if the data isn't encrypted in transit.
