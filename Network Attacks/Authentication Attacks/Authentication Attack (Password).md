**Types of Attack:**
1. Password Guessing: Guessing a password requires some knowledge of the target, such as their petâ€™s name and birth year.
2. Dictionary Attack: This approach expands on password guessing and attempts to include all valid words in a dictionary or a wordlist.
3. Brute Force Attack: This attack is the most exhaustive and time-consuming where an attacker can go as far as trying all possible character combinations, which grows fast (exponential growth with the number of characters).
